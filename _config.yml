          Four eye review system
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Built a four-eye review system to protect manual money movement caused by internal tools, systems and scripts.
          Integrated the system with Airbnb spinnaker one-off pipelines to protect all one-off scripts with an additional review.
          Integrated with various internal tools like Money transfer tool, Budgeting system, Photography payment tool, coupon admin tool and incentives tools for protecting money movements, coupons, credits and gift cards
          Moved the system from Step functions to Temporal for efficient long polling.
          Provided multiple options for review management systems like Jira, Asana, Airtable.
